            <p>Feelings and emotions. Fee
                lings and emotions. Not truly
                a magazine in the traditional sense. A collection 
                of works of arts, namely 
                poetry, by Vukile Ngubane. 
                A naive poet.

        <div><h2>The Boy</h2>
            The boy who ran away from home,
            never found his way back. His guardian angels are still search
            ing. In hell, heaven, the earth
            and in the stars. But he was ne
            ver found, because he lost hims
            elf. Trying to find himself in 
            the culture. A story of love, self
            discovery and transtion into manhood.
            Something like a blossoming flower boy.
